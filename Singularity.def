%help
    This is a singularity container written to be compatible with fvtools.
    In particular, this container guarantees that:
      - numpy is compatible with both cartopy and numba.
      - shapely and cartopy are compatible

    Other modules are well behaved, and subsequently have not received as extensive testing as those aforementioned ones -- please report errors :)

    Known errors when changing module versions:
    ---
    - numba or numpy upgrade: tge.py stops working, test by calling;
      M   = FVCOM_grid(gridfile)
      M.T # will automatically run tge

    - cartopy or shapely upgrade: segmentation faults when dealing with shapely geometries, test by calling;
      M.georeference()
      M.plot_grid()
      --> If this works, chances are that cartopy was installed correctly.
