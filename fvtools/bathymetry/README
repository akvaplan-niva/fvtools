Different bathymetry data sets for the Norwegian coast are available for 
download from Kartverket (https://dybdedata.kartverket.no/DybdedataInnsyn/). 
However, it is not possible to download data from larger areas in one go (2020), 
and instead of repeating the tedious task of retreiving data for individual 
grids in every new project, all the data have been dowloaded to Stokes 
(/home/frankgaa/Bathymetry). To supplement this data set in areas with no 
coverage, data from Met's NorShelf model is used. A script for processing 
the data (bathymetry.py) can be found in the same folder.

Datasets
 * gridded50_xyz - The best data set from Kartverket. 
		   It is based on multibeam echo soundings and is available 
                   on a grid of 50 m resolution. Only available for some 
                   areas of the coast.
 * primaer_data_xyz -  An older data set from kartverket. 
                       Has data from most areas, but with poorer and irregular 
                       resolution. Used where gridded50_xyz is not available.
 * norshelf_data - The bathymetry in the Norshelf model.
                   Used where nothing else is available.
 * Norgeskyst.txt - Coastline with 20m resolution. Used to specify h = 0 at the coast.

The make_bathymetry function in bathymetry.py creates a bathymetry data set 
from a given area and saves it to disc . See function baty_langfjorden 
for example of use.
